## Project Overview
Herbitech is an AI-powered solution designed for detecting herbal plants, identifying herbal plant diseases, and supporting it's health monitoring. Using computer vision and deep learning techniques, the system can classify over 20 herbal plants and 15 different plant diseases.

## Objective
- Detect and classify herbal plants accurately  
- Identify diseases affecting these plants  
- Provide a reliable tool for herbal plant monitoring and health assessment  

## Features
- Detection of 20+ herbal plant species  
- Disease identification for 15+ plant diseases  
- Real-time plant detection using YOLO  
- High accuracy (~90%) in both plant and disease classification  

## Technologies / Tools
- **Python** for implementation and data processing  
- **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once Version 8)** for object detection  
- **OpenCV** for image processing  
- **NumPy / Pandas** for data handling  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation and documentation  

## Dataset
- 3,000+ images covering 20+ herbal plants and 15 different plant diseases  
- Images include different angles, lighting conditions, and healthy/diseased plants  

## Methodology
1. Collected and preprocessed images for training  
2. Annotated plant and disease regions for supervised learning  
3. Trained YOLO model to detect and classify plants and diseases  
4. Validated the model on a test dataset for accuracy  
5. Fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize detection performance  

## Results
- Achieved ~80%-85% accuracy in herbal plant detection  
- Achieved ~80%-85% accuracy in disease identification  
- Deployed the mobile and web app

## Future Work
- Expand the dataset to include more herbal plants and diseases  
- Integrate a health monitoring dashboard with alerts for detected diseases  

A new Flutter project.
